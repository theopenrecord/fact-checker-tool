Known Strengths
✅ Lightning-fast performance from hybrid architecture
✅ Comprehensive source coverage across fact-checking organizations
✅ Professional UI/UX ready for public use
✅ Mobile responsive design
✅ Privacy-focused data handling
Development Priorities
🔄 Bias detection integration (AllSides/Newstrition APIs)
📋 Meme OCR capability for image-based claims
📋 URL fact-checking for direct link analysis
📋 Advanced result filtering and sorting options
🔧 Technical Implementation
Core Search Algorithm
javascript// Hybrid search strategy
async function performFactCheck(claim) {
    const results = [];
    
    // 1. Fast cache lookup (server-side RSS)
    const cacheResults = await searchLocalCache(claim);
    results.push(...cacheResults);
    
    // 2. Live API search (Google Custom Search)
    const liveResults = await searchGoogleAPI(claim);
    results.push(...liveResults);
    
    // 3. Deduplicate and rank
    return processAndRankResults(results);
}
Source Grouping Logic
javascript// Group results by publisher for clean display
function groupSourcesByPublisher(articles) {
    const grouped = new Map();
    
    articles.forEach(article => {
        const publisher = extractPublisher(article.link);
        if (!grouped.has(publisher)) {
            grouped.set(publisher, []);
        }
        grouped.get(publisher).push(article);
    });
    
    return rankSourcesByReliability(grouped);
}
